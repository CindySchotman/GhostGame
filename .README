  Ghost - This app first welcomes you on the settings page after first opening the app. Here two players have to
  type their name (after playing it for some time a list of used names is available) and choose a language. With
  the 'GAME RULES' you can find the description of the game.
  After the user has read this it taps the 'BACK'-button which will bring the user back to the settings page
  from where the game can be started with the button 'PLAY'.
  
  Here the game starts with Player 1's turn. The name of the player on turn stands right under the title-balk so
  it's clear who's turn it is. Right under that stands the score and letters of the player on turn. Centered in
  the screen stands the letters of the not-yet-formed word. Under that word just above the keyboard is the score
  and the letters of the second player. After giving in a letter the turn goes to the other player and the names, scores
  and letters switch from place. As long as the game is not finished the user stays on this screen. By tapping the
  'SETTINGS'-button the users go bach to the settings. Tapping the 'MENU'-button will bring the user to the MENU-screen.
  
  In the menu the 'RESUME'-button is found first, to go back to the game. There is also a button to start a new game.
  Also a 'GAME RULES'-button is displayed which will go back to the activity where the game is explained. As the game
  continues this will lead to a winner and a loser. As the game is finished a new activity will appear. This will
  tell who the winner is and that the other player lost the game by completing 'GHOST'. From here a new game can be
  started or the user can go the the highScore-screen, where the high scores can be seen by scrolling through it.
