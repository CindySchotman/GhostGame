  Ghost - This app first welcomes you to the app. On the first Activity you can find the description of the game. After the user has read this it taps the 'GET STARTED!'-button which will bring the user to the second activity. Here the user can chose for a name for Player 1 as well for Player 2. This can be a name chosen from the list of already exsisting names or it can be typed in. While choosing a name the rest of the screen will be dimmed. Also the user can choose for playing the game in Dutch or in English using the switch. When the user is ready to start the game he or she can tap the 'PLAY'-button, which will bring the user to the next activity. Here the game starts with Player 1's turn. The name of the player on turn stands in the title-balk so it's clear who's turn it is. Right under the title-balk stands the score and letters of the player on turn. Centered in the screen stands the letters of the not-yet-formed word. Under that word just above the keyboard is the score and the letters of the second player. This is displayed in smaller letters to show it is less important than the score and letters of the first player. After giving in a letter the turn goes to the other player and the score and letters switch (sliding) from place. As long as the game is not finished the user stays on this screen. The only other screen to reach from this point is the menu. This can be accessed by the 'MENU'-button in the upper right corner, under the title-balk. In the menu the switch for the English or Dutch version of the game is back. There is also a button to restart the game. An 'Options'-button displayed as the typical 'Options'-icon. This goes back to the first activity where the user can choose the names and the language, but instead of the 'PLAY'-button the 'RETURN'-button is displayed to go back to the menu. Also at the bottem of the menu a 'Help'-button is displayed with the questionmark as icon. This will go back to the activity there the game is explained. From the menu the 'RESUME'-button brings the user back to the game. As the game continues this will lead to a winner and a loser. As the game is finished a new activity will appear. This will tell who the winner is and how the other player lost the game. Eighter the losing player completed a word or added a wrong letter. From here a new game can be started or the user can go the the option-screen. Also the high score can be watched by scrolling through it.
